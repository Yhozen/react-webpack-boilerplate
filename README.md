Yet Another React Boilerplate for react projects with ES2017 syntax and hot reloader using Webpack 3. Works like create-react-app but it's just [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) with [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel). Project based on [vasanthk boilerplate](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-es6-webpack-boilerplate) with some updates and additions

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
Open http://localhost:5000
```

Change src/App.js at your will, you can import css directly or even import images (jpg, jpeg, png or svg). To build the bundle just run ```npm run build``` and copy the index.html as well as the static folder.
